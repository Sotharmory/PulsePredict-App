Overview
PulsePredict App is a comprehensive application designed to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in predicting the likelihood of heart disease using various data inputs. The app integrates multiple functionalities, including predictive analytics, text extraction from images, and a chat bot for interactive assistance.

Key Features
PulsePredict

The core functionality of the app is its predictive model for heart disease. Users can input various health parameters such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. The model processes these inputs to predict the risk of heart disease. This feature is useful for initial screenings and assessments, helping users and healthcare providers make informed decisions.

Text Extraction from Images

The app includes a text extraction feature that uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract and recognize text from images. This is particularly useful for digitizing handwritten or printed medical documents, reports, and forms. Users can upload images through the app, and the text will be extracted and made available for further use or analysis.

Chat Bot Integration

To enhance user experience and provide real-time support, the app features a chat bot. The chat bot can answer user queries, provide information about heart disease, and assist with using the appâ€™s various features. It utilizes natural language processing to engage in meaningful conversations and offer relevant responses.
